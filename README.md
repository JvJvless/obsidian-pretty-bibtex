# Pretty BibTeX Obsidian Plugin

This plugin renders bibliography entries in the BibTeX format in a more readable way.


## Demonstration

Creating a standard code block with the language set to "bibtex" will transform your raw bibliography entry:

~~~markdown
```bibtex
<your BibTeX entry goes here>
```
~~~

The header color is defined by the `'Accent color'` in Obsidian.
